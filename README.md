Aug 2020 – Present

Project descriptionOur 24h Hackathon project that got us second place in the podium!

A casino-like website concept where anyone can become a millionaire by playing with nothing but mere pennies.

With 3 months of experience we built this project from scratch within 24h utilizing Java, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Spring MVC, the Maven WebApp Archetype, Tomcat and RESTful API.

We also got to finally put to practice our taught work methodologies and took advantage of a Scrum workflow with Kanban to better manage our time, as well as Git to keep the project in order.
